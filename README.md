**Jekyllized Story** is a Franken-theme created mostly from HTML5 UP's [Story](https://html5up.net/story) with a drawer menu and blog layout from [Phantom](https://html5up.net/phantom), and a custom header menu. Much of the Jekyllization is based on [andrewbanchich's Jekyllized Phantom Theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/phantom-jekyll-theme).

# Quick Start
* documentation and example are available in this [forked version](https://creativedirections.github.io/jekyllized-story/), the [example page](https://creativedirections.github.io/jekyllized-story/examples/items.html#reference-items) is particularly useful!
* for installation of all the jekyll required toolings, check [this repo](https://github.com/ohjho/ohjho.github.io#getting-started), otherwise a simple `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` should get your site up on localhost:4000 (pay attention to the `baseurl` setting in `_config.yml`)
